# Security Policy

This is a research prototype. If you discover a vulnerability or unsafe behavior:

- Open a PRIVATE issue or email: asadullahrahoo98@gmail.com
- Do not include sensitive data in logs
- Safety-critical bugs (optical/electrical) should disable hardware quickly

We follow best-effort disclosure and document mitigations in `docs/RISK_REGISTER.md`.
