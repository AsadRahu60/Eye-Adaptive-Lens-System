# Data & Privacy Notes

- **No personal identifiers** stored in device logs; use anonymous IDs.
- Store only technical telemetry and session metrics (comfort 0â€“10, success).
- For research, keep a separate consent record (outside this repo).
- When exporting data, remove exact timestamps or offset them if needed.
- Version the ML model and record model hash in reports for reproducibility.
