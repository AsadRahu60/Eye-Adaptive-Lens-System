# User Requirements Specification (URS)

## Purpose
Define user needs for the Adaptive Lens System to support amblyopia research and therapy.

## Stakeholders
- Patients (children & adults with amblyopia)
- Ophthalmologists / clinicians
- Researchers in vision science
- Engineers (QA, embedded systems)

## Requirements
1. Device must allow **per-eye focus control** with Â±6D range.
2. Device must allow **per-eye shutter occlusion** with smooth transitions.
3. Provide **context-aware modes** (near/desk/outdoor).
4. Must log therapy sessions (time, mode, duration).
5. Must allow **manual override** by clinician or researcher.
6. Ensure **patient safety**: no sudden light flashes, bounded lens shifts.
7. Support **remote monitoring** through BLE/Wi-Fi.
